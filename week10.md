The paper I chose this week is titled "A survey of competitive sports data visualization and visual analysis".
The paper talks about the importance of competitive sports data visualization and notes its significance for studying human behavior and activity patterns. 
The paper breaks sports data into two groups, stats (traditional) and spatiotemporal data (movement).
It identifies the main tasks of data viz as feature presentation, comparison, and prediction. 
The paper talks about using high dimensional data visualizations, time series visualizations, network visualizations, and glyph visualizations to display complex sports data.
The document explores the relationships between data types, visualization tasks, and techniques.
It offers guidance on selecting appropriate methods for specific analysis objectives.
The challenges with this are data collection and processing the data, but the biggest probelm is universal readibility.
With high dimensional data, it is difficult to create visualizations that can be easily understood by the masses.
The paper calls for the integration of machine learning into data viz to improve analysis.
