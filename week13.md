The paper I chose this week is called "Big Data Visualizationsin Organizational Science" by Louis Tay.
The paper expolores how big data visualizations can be utilized in organizational research.
The authors talked about how traditional methods of data visualization struggled with the scale of big data.
They stated that it was necessary to test new approaches that were better able to handle high-dimensional data.
The authors offered a variety of solutions to solve the problems associated with visualizing big data effectively. 
They created visualizations with different techniques, such as creating interactive and dynamic graphs.
The authors highlighted how data visualization was switching to a more exploratory subspace.
They pushed the idea that improving data visualization was the key in improving the understanding of big data.
