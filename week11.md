The paper that I read this week was titled "ArcTrees: Visualizing Relations in Hierarchical Data".
The paper talks about combining Treemaps with arc diagrams to visualize hierarchial and relational data easier.
It talks about how the ArcTrees can be used to explore structured documents, such as textbooks.
The inclusion of interactive ArcTrees in scientific text would allow for easier navigation and information display.
Interactive techniques in the ArcTrees includes highlighting connected nodes and expanding/collapsing subtrees.
Node weights and color coding are done to visualize hierarchy in the data. 
Arcs are used to visualize relationships.
I found ArcTrees to be an interesting improvement on traditional Arc diagrams.
I am working on an arc diagram for our final project and will look into wether or not it would be useful to change it to and ArcTree.
