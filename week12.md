The paper I read this week is titled "Visualizing and Interacting with Geospatial Networks: A Survey and Design Space" by Sarah Sch√∂ttler.
The paper focuses on visualization and interaction techniques for geospatial networks. 
These include social, trade, and migration networks.
The authors discuss the challenges involved with integrating the networks with other data that is now able to be directly displayed in the network mapping.
They also talk to the difficulties in integrating additional visualizations into the networks.
They focus on the trade off between displaying detailed information and maintaining the network structure.
Throughout the paper, the authors reference many different case studies.
One of the major case studies involved mapping the London Underground and the problems around it.
They focused on the different techniques used to map the underground and the current map.
Overall the paper was interesting and it gave a good look into the visualization strategies used by the authors.
