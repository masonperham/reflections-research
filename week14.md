The visualization paper that I read this week was called "Big Data Visualization Tools: A Survey - The New Paradigms, Methodologies and Tools for Large Data Sets Visualization".
The paper talks about the importance of visualization in the modern data age. 
It emphacizes the need for visualization tools due to the many interactions between humans and data.
The paper breaks down 'big data' and explains the rapid increase of data and data usage.
The paper coins the term the "3Vs" - which are Volume, Velocity, and Variety.
Volume refers to the enormous quantities of data generated from multiple sources, which require scalable storage and processing capabilities.
Velocity indicates the rapid rate at which data is produced and processed, necessitating real-time analysis and decision-making capabilities.
Variety covers the diverse forms of data, structured and unstructured, challenging organizations to adopt versatile processing tools to handle different data types effectively.
The paper looked at the 3Vs and created an evaluation network for comparing big data visualizations across various types.
